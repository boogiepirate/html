         <h3 class='photographer'>When Benny came to photograph my art exhibition, he didn't just ask us to pose. He would ask us to talk.
         To think. To joke. He really captured the emotions we felt as we admired artwork with our friends</h3>

        <h1 class='intro-home'>Perfect engagement photos!</h1>
        <h3 class='photographer'>We called him and he asked, "so what do you love doing?". Next thing we know, we're out long-boarding on <thead>
          beach in our fancy clothes. We got some perfect shots at golden hour, and the pics exemplify us so well.

        <h1 class='intro-home'>Great for the FAM</h1>
        <h3 class='photographer'>Benny arrived at our house while we were eating cereal. Instead of waiting for us to get ready, he just
        started taking pictures at the breakfast table. Out of all of them, we kept those because of how real they felt. Loved his stuff.</h3>

       <h1 class='intro-home'>Wowza!</h1>
       <h3 class='photographer'>When I told him we liked meat, we decided to go to a butchery. he had us hold meat up as a family smiling,
       it sounds wierd but our friends love the pictures!</h3>
